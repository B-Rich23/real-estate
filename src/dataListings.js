            description: "Stunning detached family home in a very special setting along a private lane close to Summertown.This detached house was originally constructed in the late 1920's and in recent years has undergone a comprehensive programme of extension and refurbishment to transform it into a modern family home with unique character. The property has been elegantly designed throughout whilst maximising space and light simultaneously. Arranged over two floors with a great deal of living space and a homely and tastefully refurbished kitchen/family room. There are five good sized bedrooms including a ground floor suite which would be ideal for relatives or teenage children.The house has a light and airy feel throughout and still retains much of its original character. Situated along a private lane adjacent to Lynams school the house feels as though it is in the country yet is within easy walking distance of central Summertown with its vibrant amenities. Set back from the lane with electrically operated wooden gates with a long driveway and turning area providing ample car-parking, the gardens extend to all sides of the property and measure circa 0.26 acres with lawns, shrubs trees and borders. Beyond the kitchen is a private and enclosed terrace with borders and has a south/westerly aspect. There is also a large wooden storage shed with undercover bicycle store.Please contact the office for further information or to arrange a viewing.",
